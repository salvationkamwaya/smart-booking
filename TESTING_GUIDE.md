## 🔧 Developer Testing

### JavaScript Console Testing
Open browser DevTools and run these commands:

```javascript
// Test the app state
console.log('Current app state:', BookingApp.state);

// Test API manually
fetch('/client/api/providers').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);

// Test provider selection
BookingApp.selectProvider(1); // Replace 1 with actual provider ID

// Test booking state
console.log('Selected provider:', BookingApp.state.selectedProvider);
console.log('Selected service:', BookingApp.state.selectedService);
```

### Network Tab Verification
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Perform booking actions
3. Verify these API calls occur:
   - `GET /client/api/providers`
   - `GET /client/api/slots-by-date?date=YYYY-MM-DD&providerId=X`
   - `POST /client/api/book-appointment`

### Database Verification
Check that these tables have data:
```sql
-- Check providers
SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'PROVIDER';

-- Check time slots
SELECT * FROM time_slots WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE;

-- Check appointments after booking
SELECT * FROM appointments ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```
